**Why should I own precious metals?**

Precious metals are historically very reliable stores of wealth that have helped individuals protect their purchasing power for several centuries. While currencies issued by governments can become worthless, precious metals never do.


**What is Anthem Vault?**

Anthem Vault is an online precious metal retailer that provides U.S. residents with an efficient and liquid way to buy, own and sell physical, 100% fine stored and insured gold and silver bullion. The company is incorporated as a Nevada corporation under the name “Anthem Vault, Inc.” and is regulated as a precious metal dealer by the USA Patriot Act.

**Is Anthem Vault a bank?**

No. The distinction is that deposits held in a bank checking or savings account are used by the bank to create new loans.
Anthem Vault is a precious metal dealer and nonbank custodian of client metal, and does not have the legal right to loan out or use client metal as the company’s collateral with its own creditors and neither does the independent, third-party nonbank vaulting facility it uses to store the metal bars.
If for any reason we stopped doing business, 100% of your assets in the form of physical bars, bank check, or both if you choose, can be quickly and easily distributed back to you.

**Our Founder**

Anthem Vault was founded in February 2011 by CEO Anthem Blanchard. Anthem brings his extensive knowledge of the gold and silver industry from both his experience as Director of Strategic Development and Marketing with European-based company GoldMoney, as well as from being raised by a goldbug and precious metals pioneer James U. Blanchard III, who helped restore Americans’ right to own gold and founded the rare coin and bullion company Blanchard & Company.
During Anthem’s tenure with GoldMoney, he helped develop and implement their current business model and oversaw marketing and product development efforts, which resulted in an increase of total value held by the company from $1 million in 2002 to $368 million by 2008. Today, the company holds over $2 billion in client assets. He also assisted thousands of clients by answering their questions regarding buying gold and silver.
From 2010 to 2014, Anthem served as an independent director and member of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee at Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (ticker symbol: PTX, traded on NASDAQ), a Russell 2000 pharmaceutical company based in The Woodlands, Texas.
Anthem holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) from Goizueta Business School at Emory University with concentrations in Professional Accounting (CPA) and Finance.


**Trust through Transparency**

Trust through Transparency is the term that we at Anthem Vault use to describe how open we are to our clients. We do not want any unanswered questions about our product to be on anyone’s mind. To achieve this goal, we provide information on bar audits and vault insurance to our clients.


**Bar Audits and Tests**

Anthem Vault only purchases metal bars from world-renowned manufacturers who are on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) list. Every day, the world-class vaulting facility that we use in Salt Lake City, Utah performs a bar count and audit of all bars currently held. It sends the bar audit to Anthem Vault, and we provide these documents to our clients.
Every time a bar enters or leaves our vault, a new audit is performed of all the bars then stored in the vault. In addition, each bar added to our vault is sonically tested for purity and weight to ensure the highest quality and integrity of all metal purchased by Anthem Vault clients.

**Insurance**

Gold and silver are historically one of the most secure ways to store wealth and purchasing power. Their value and portability make them perfect containers to retain value, but those factors can also create a difficult situation if the metal ever gets lost or stolen. Because of this, it is extremely important to insure your investment. However, many home insurance policies will not cover precious metal bullion and those that do are often prohibitively expensive.
Our bullion is insured for loss by theft or natural disaster. Details of the coverage provided under the policy can be obtained upon request.

**Company Audits**

It is not enough that Anthem Vault purchases only high quality bars, storing those bars securely in a world class vaulting facility, and protecting that metal with a commercial grade insurance policy. We know that our clients need to know that they can trust us as a company in our capacity as the custodian of their metal. The best way to prove ourselves and earn our clients trust is by having a reputable third party company audit our financials.
